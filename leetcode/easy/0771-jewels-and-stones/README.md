# Jewels and Stones

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
- jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
- All the characters of jewels are unique.

            for(int j=0;j<stones.length();j++){
                if(stones.charAt(j)==jewels.charAt(i)){
                    c++;
                }
            }
        
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
